# Generating Art with Neural Networks

Inspired by my students, this directory contains code to generate art with the library [neuralart](https://pypi.org/project/neuralart/).

## Requirements
- Python 3+
- Knowledge of executing code from command line and an IDE to write python scripts.

## Instructions
1. Install the library neuralart
```bash
  pip3 install neuralart
```

2. Execute this code in your terminal to create an image generated by a randomly initialised neural network.
```bash
  neuralart \
      --seed 2 \
      --xres 2048 \
      --hidden-std 1.2 \
      random-example.png
```

3. If you would to create multiple images generated by the neural network, you can create a python script similar to this [example.py](https://github.com/shaq31415926/creative-programming/blob/main/ai_frankfurt_workshop/src/example.py) and play around with the different parameters.  

```
python3 example.py
```

4. To convert the images to a video, carry out the following steps:

Install the library opencv 

```bash
  pip3 install opencv-python
```

You can create a python script similar to this [image_to_video.py](https://github.com/shaq31415926/creative-programming/blob/main/ai_frankfurt_workshop/src/image_to_video.py) which reads all the images and converts to a video.

```
python3 image_to_video.py
```
